# Bachelor_studies

Welcome to my repository!

Here are the main projects and homeworks on Python completed during my Bachelor's Degree in Economics (2019-2023) in the Higher School of Economics (Moscow, Russia).

They are intended to give a general idea of my knowledge both in the field of data analysis in general and the Python programming language in particular.

All of the works are translated in English, however, some insignificant comments can be still in Russian since the majority of the Python courses were in my native language.

The datasets can be downloaded from websites/drives/clouds using the commands presented in the notebooks. The outputs of the cells are preserved.
