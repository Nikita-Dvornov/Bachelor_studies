# Bachelor_studies

Here are the main projects and homeworks completed during the Bachelor's Degree in Economics (2019-2023) in the Higher School of Economics (Moscow, Russia).

All of the works are translated in English, however, some comments can be still in Russian since the majority of the Python courses were in my native language.

The datasets can be downloaded from websites/drives/clouds using the commands presented in the notebooks. The outputs of the cells are preserved.
